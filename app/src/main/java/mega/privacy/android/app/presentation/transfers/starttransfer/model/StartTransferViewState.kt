 * @property jobInProgressState Job storing the transfer progress if any.
 * @property confirmLargeDownload user needs to confirm a large download if not null.
 * @property askDestinationForDownload user needs to choose a destination for this [TransferTriggerEvent.DownloadTriggerEvent]. Depending on Android version and user settings, download destination should be asked for each new download.
 * @property requestFilesPermissionDenied True if the user denied the files permission request.
